I suspect that there's a more efficient way to do this without slurping the whole file, but I wasn't sure how
to handle the case of sequences that broke across lines without a lot of tweaking for that.

I didn't really do TDD here, which made glomming the test framework on at the end just add complexity without buying much. This is less than ideal obviously.
